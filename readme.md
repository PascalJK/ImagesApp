## App Goal
- Developed this app for users to be able to upload multiple images with sizes ranging from mainly around *20-55MB*.

## Issues
- Application seems to crash when I upload Images with a high res.
- If the application doesn't crash it takes long to finally display the images to the user.
- I have seen the application log some messages in the output window:
**'[System] A resource failed to call close.'**
- Sample images used can be downloaded from [effigis](https://effigis.com/en/solutions/satellite-images/satellite-image-samples/).
